INTRODUCTION                                    *toggle-terminal-introduction*

Toggle-terminal is a plugin for nvim that can spone a terminal in a dedicated
buffer, display the terminal buffer is a split window, and toggle this window.
There can be only one terminal buffer that Toggle-terminal know about, called
"main terminal" through this documentation. If the main terminal is exited
(ie. the terminal processus ends), a new terminal instance will be created
next time toggle-terminal is summoned.

Features:

* create a main terminal buffer and open it in a new split window below the
  current one
* toggle the main terminal
* terminal buffer is unlisted (hidden  from `:ls` command)
* terminal background color can be different than normal background color


COMMANDS                           *:Toggleterminal*  *toggle-terminal-commands*

Toggle-terminal does not define any default keybindings for nvim. The command
|:Toggleterminal| does two things:

1. The first time it is called (or if the main terminal is exited): create a
   new buffer, open a terminal in this buffer and display the buffer in a
   split window below the current one
2. Every other times: toggle a split window displaying the main terminal
