INTRODUCTION                                             *one-term-introduction*

one-term is a plugin for nvim that can spone a terminal in a dedicated buffer,
display the terminal buffer is a split window, and toggle this window. There
can be only one terminal buffer that one-term know about, called "main
terminal" through this documentation. If the main terminal is exited (ie. the
terminal processus ends), a new terminal instance will be created next time
one-term is summoned.


COMMANDS                                                *:Oneterm*  *one-term-cmd*

one-term provides only one user command |:Oneterm| and does not define any
default keybindings for nvim. The |:Oneterm| command takes at least one
argument which is the subcommand name. The subcommand may (or may not) have
arguments.

`:Oneterm <subcommand> [args...]`

The subcommands are listed below.


SUBCOMMAND CLEAR                                            *one-term-cmd-clear*

Clear the terminal window, without entering the terminal buffer. This is
equivalent to Ctrl-L.


SUBCOMMAND EXIT                                              *one-term-cmd-exit*

Exit the terminal processus, without entering the terminal buffer. If you have
nested shells, it will fall back to the previous shell. This is equivalent to
Ctrl-D.


SUBCOMMAND JUMP                                              *one-term-cmd-jump*

Jump from an error in the command output to the corresponding problematic
code.

This command may overlap in some circumstances the native errorformat
functionnality (see `:h error-file-format`). If you are using a compiler and
you build your program with `:make` you should probably use this native
functionnality instead, and commands like `:copen`, `:cnext` etc. The _jump_
subcommand is convenient when you run a script directly in the main terminal
window and when this script returns error messages (without calling `:make`
command). You can then jump directly to the problematic location.

If this subcommand does not work for a given language, it is possible to
define custom regular expressions (see `errorformat` option in the
|one-term-configuration| section). The regular expression should have two
capturing groups, the first corresponding to the file name, the second to the
line number.

Note that the order of the regular expressions in `errorformat` matters
because the first match will interrupt the search and try to jump to the
corresponding location.


SUBCOMMAND KILL                                              *one-term-cmd-kill*

Kill the currently running comment, without entering the terminal buffer. This
is equivalent to Ctrl-C.


SUBCOMMAND LAUNCH                                          *one-term-cmd-launch*

Launch a command read from a lua configuration file `.nvim/launch.lua` located
in the current directory. With no additional arguments, the command will launch
the configuration named "default". Else it will load the given configuration.
>vim
    " this two commands are equivalent
    :Oneterm launch
    :Oneterm launch default

    " launch the configuration named "custom"
    :Oneterm launch custom
<

Note that this command will not search parent directories to find the
configuration file.

`.nvim/launch.lua` example:
>lua
    return {
        configurations = {
            default = {
                cmd = {
                    "python",
                    "main.py",
                },
            },
            custom = {
                cmd = {
                    "python",
                    "main.py",
                    "argument",
                },
            },
        },
    }
<


SUBCOMMAND RESIZE                                          *one-term-cmd-resize*

Resize the terminal window. Will only work if the terminal window is open.
This subcommand takes one argument:

* `+N` -> increase the terminal height by N
* `-N` -> decrease the terminal height by N

Examples:
>vim
    " Increase the terminal height (5 lines)
    :Oneterm resize +5

    " Decrease the terminal height (1 line)
    :Oneterm resize -1
<

SUBCOMMAND RUN                                                *one-term-cmd-run*

Run an arbitrary command.

Examples:
>vim
    " Will print 'hello' to the terminal
    :Oneterm run echo hello

    " Execute ipython interpreter
    :Oneterm run ipython
<

SUBCOMMAND RUN_PREVIOUS                              *one-term-cmd-run_previous*

Run privous command, without entering the terminal buffer. This is equivalent
to Ctrl-P followed by a Carriage Return. This subcommand wont do anything if
the main terminal does not exist yet.


SUBCOMMAND SEND_CURRENT_LINE                    *one-term-cmd-send_current_line*

Send current line to the terminal buffer. Create the terminal buffer if it
does not exist yet. If the terminal buffer exists but it's window is closed,
open it.


SUBCOMMAND SEND_VISUAL_LINES                    *one-term-cmd-send_visual_lines*

Send selected lines to the terminal buffer. Create the terminal buffer if it
does not exist yet. If the terminal buffer exists but it's window is closed,
open it.


SUBCOMMAND SEND_VISUAL_SELECTION            *one-term-cmd-send_visual_selection*

Send selected text to the terminal buffer. Create the terminal buffer if it
does not exist yet. If the terminal buffer exists but it's window is closed,
open it.


SUBCOMMAND TOGGLE_FULLHEIGHT                    *one-term-cmd-toggle_fullheight*

Allow the user to toggle the terminal height when it's window is displayed. It
will resize the terminal window in such a way that it will occupy the maximum
height (leaving only one line for the top window). Note that the height is
relative to the whole neovim height (vim.o.lines) and not the height of the
current window.


SUBCOMMAND TOGGLE_WINDOW                            *one-term-cmd-toggle_window*

The subcommand `toggle_window` does two things:

1. The first time it is called (or if the main terminal is exited): create a
   new buffer, open a terminal in this buffer and display the buffer in a
   split window below the current one
2. Every other times: toggle a split window displaying the main terminal


EXAMPLES                                                 *one-term-cmd-examples*

Here are some usage examples.
>vim
    " Create a split window and open a new terminal
    :Oneterm toggle_window

    " Close the window (the terminal will still run in the background)
    :Oneterm toggle_window

    " Terminal buffer is unlisted
    :ls

    " You can see the terminal buffer this way
    :ls!

    " Open the terminal window again
    :Oneterm toggle_window

    " Increase the terminal height to the maximum
    :Oneterm toggle_fullheight

    " Back to initial size
    :Oneterm toggle_fullheight

    " When on an error message, jump to the corresponding problematic code
    :Oneterm jump

    " Send current line to the terminal buffer
    :Oneterm send_current_line

    " Send currently selected lines to the terminal buffer
    :Oneterm send_visual_lines

    " Run previously executed command without leaving your current buffer
    :Oneterm run_previous

    " This command takes too much time... kill it without leaving your current buffer
    :Oneterm kill

    " Clear terminal window without leaving your current buffer
    :Oneterm clear

    " You dont need your terminal anymore, you can exit it without leaving your buffer
    :Oneterm exit

CONFIGURATION                                           *one-term-configuration*

Default configuration:
>lua
    require("one-term").setup {}
<
Note that if you are satisfied with the defaults, it is not even required to
call the setup function. Just put the plugin into your runtimepath. The plugin
will lazy-load itself on the first `Oneterm` command.

Advanced configuration:
>lua
    require('one-term').setup {
        bg_color_factor = 0.75,  -- factor to compute term bg color
        startinsert = false,  -- start insert mode at term opening
        local_options = {
            number = false,  -- no number in main terminal window
            relativenumber = false,  -- no relative number in main terminal window
            cursorline = false,  -- cursor line in main terminal window
            colorcolumn = '',  -- color column
            scrolloff = 0,  -- scrolloff can be disturbing in terminal window
        },
        -- regex patterns used to jump to the error location
        errorformat = {
            "([^ :]*):([0-9]):", -- lua / cpp
            '^ *File "(.*)", line ([0-9]+)', -- python
            "^(.*): line ([0-9]+)", -- bash
        },
        enabled_layouts = {
            "vertical",
            "horizontal",
            "floating",
        },
        vertical = {
            relative_height = 0.35,
        },
        horizontal = {
            relative_width = 0.5,
        },
        floating = {
            relative_height = 0.7,
            relative_width = 0.7,
        },
    }

Details about configuration items ~

    bg_color_factor: ~

        The background color is calculated by applying a factor to each red /
        green / blue part of the Normal background highlight group, so the
        terminal background is different, but consistent with the colorscheme.
        Setting this option to 1 means that the terminal background will be
        the same as the Normal background. Smaller values will give darker
        backgrounds, higher values will give lighter backgrounds. Values
        beetween 0.75 and 1.25 will usually give good results, feel free to
        experiment.

    startinsert: ~

        Start insert mode automatically when the terminal is summoned.

    relative_height: ~

        Relative height of the terminal window. Note that it is relative to
        the total height (`vim.o.lines`), not the height of the current
        window.

    local_options: ~

        Vim options table that can be set locally to the terminal window. See
        the default setup for available options.

    errorformat: ~

        Regular expressions table used by the `jump` subcommand. See
        |one-term-cmd-jump| for details.
